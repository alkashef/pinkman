# Vision & Problem
- One-line vision: A lightweight Streamlit front end for AI appsâ€”a single-page chat interface.
- Problem statement: Offer a no-frills chat UI that connects to an AI agent backend, with zero configuration and no sign-in.
- Value proposition (why this, why now): Speed up demos and prototypes by cutting UX boilerplate so you can focus on agent logic.
- Quickly iterate with tools like LangChain or CrewAI; cleaner than a CLI and capable of richer outputs than plain text.
